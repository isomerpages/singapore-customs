## About Customs@SG

The  [**Customs@SG**  web application](https://m.customs.gov.sg/CustomsTravellerPortal) is a convenient way for travellers to declare and pay duty and/or Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their overseas purchases anytime, anywhere, before the travellers arrive in Singapore.

Travellers with purchases that have exceeded their personal  [duty free concession or GST relief](/individuals/going-through-customs/arrivals/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief) can use  **Customs@SG** web application to make an advance declaration and pay the duty and/or GST without having to visit the Customs Tax Payment Office at the checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore. Once payment has been made, travellers will be notified via email, and travellers have the option of downloading the receipt from the web application. Travellers can proceed to exit the checkpoint by the Customs Green Channel. When they are stopped for checks, travellers can show the e-receipts on their mobile device or printed hardcopy receipts as proof of payment.

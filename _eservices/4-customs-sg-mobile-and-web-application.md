## About Customs@SG

The  **Customs@SG**  mobile app is a convenient way for travellers to declare and pay duty and/or Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their overseas purchases anytime, anywhere, before the travellers arrive in Singapore.

Travellers with purchases that have exceeded their personal  [duty free concession or GST relief](https://www.customs.gov.sg/individuals/going-through-customs/arrival/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief) can use  **Customs@SG**  to make an advance declaration and pay the duty and/or GST without having to visit the Customs Tax Payment Office at the checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore. Once payment has been made, the app will automatically create an e-receipt in the traveller’s mobile phone. Travellers can proceed to exit the checkpoint by the Customs Green Channel. When they are stopped for checks, travellers can show the e-receipts on their smartphone as proof of payment.

Travellers can also choose to declare and pay the taxes online through the  **Customs@SG**  web portal.

Upon your arrival, please present the controlled goods and the accompanying import permit or authorisation form to the checking officer at the Customs Red Channel.

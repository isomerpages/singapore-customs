# Singapore Police Force - Public Entertainment & Liquor Licensing Division (PELU) - Police Licensing & Regulatory Department (PLRD)

Police Licensing and Regulatory Department (PLRD) regulates the importation and use of amusement game machines in Singapore. Before an amusement game machine is imported into Singapore, an approval to import and operate such machines is required. Importers of the game machines are required to submit their applications to PLRD for approval at least six weeks before the arrival of the goods in Singapore. The application must be supported with as much information about the item as possible e.g. brochures (in English) with pictures of game machines and describing the objectives and modes of play. PLRD will assess the application and will inform the importer / applicant of the result. Such application is to be submitted to PLRD via spf_licensing_feedback@spf.gov.sg. A customs permit must also be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in Singapore.

Operators of such game machines will have to obtain a separate public entertainment licence from PLRD to allow public to access such games. The operators can apply for PE licence online via the [licence1.business.gov.sg](http://licence1.business.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

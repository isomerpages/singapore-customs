## Guidelines on Declaration of Importation of Telecommunication Equipment

-   Every imported telecommunication equipment should be declared through TradeNet to the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) for processing. A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in Singapore. Please refer to the  [procedures for the import of telecommunication equipment and the list of AHTN and product codes](https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/dealer-and-equipment-registration-framework/tradenet---list-of--ahtn-codes){:target="_blank"}. All dealers or importers are requested to comply with the procedures.

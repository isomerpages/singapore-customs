# National Environment Agency - Chemical Control and Management Department (Hazardous Substances)

Before you submit the import/export permit application to the TradeNet System for auto-processing, you need to go through the items having CCMD-controlled HS Codes to see if any of them have ingredients which are listed in Part I of the Second Schedule of the Environmental Protection And Management Act (EPMA). If so, the importer/exporter must possess a valid Hazardous Substances Licence from CCMD. For more information on the control of hazardous substances in Singapore, please visit  [CCMD website](http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/chemical-safety/hazardous-substances/management-of-hazardous-substances){:target="_blank"}.

In order to have your permit application processed smoothly without being rejected, you are advised to take note of the following:

1.  Determine the appropriate Product Code  
    
    Sort out the import/export items having HS codes that are controlled by CCMD. Then check the detailed chemical composition of these items to look out for ingredients that are listed in the Part I of the Second Schedule of the EPMA. Items having such chemical ingredients controlled under the EPMA are to be declared using a CCMD product code.
    
    For example:
    
    The HS code to be declared for your product is 38089119.
    
    The composition of your product is : Fenthion 55%
    
    Emulsifiers 30%
    
    Xylene 15%
    
    Total 100%
    
    In this example, Fenthion is controlled under the EPMA and the product code to be declared is PCDFEN115. You are also required to provide the product code quantity and its unit of quantity in KGM.
    
    In addition, you need to declare the composition of the Fenthion, i.e. 55, in the "CA/SC Code1" field found at the item level of the Import/Export Permit application. You need not declare the percentage sign (i.e. %) in the "CA/SC Code1" field.
    
    The list of HS codes and Product codes for CCMD controlled items can be found in Appendix C.
    
2.  Declare the Maximum Quantity Per Trip  
    
    For controlled hazardous chemicals found in the Environmental Protection And Management (Hazardous Substances) Regulations, you are required to declare the maximum quantity of chemicals to be transported per trip (computed in "KGM") in the "CA/SC Code2" field found at the "item" level in the Import Permit application. It is not necessary to key in the unit of quantity "KGM" in the "CA/SC Code2" field. For quantities per trip exceeding the limits in The Schedule of the EPM(HS) Reg, you are required to have a transport approval from CCMD for your permit application to be processed smoothly.
    
    Example:
    
    If the maximum qty per trip is 1 TNE, you are required to key in "1000" for 1000 kilograms in the "CA/SC Code2" field.
    
3.  Comply with the messages from the TradeNet system  
    
    You are not required to fax any document to CCMD unless you are prompted by the TradeNet system to submit certain documents to CCMD for verification.
    

Note:

1.  A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from Singapore.
2.  The list of chemicals controlled by CCMD and the corresponding exclusions can be found in the Part I of the Second Schedule of the Environmental Protection And Management Act (EPMA). General Exemptions can be found in Part II of the same Schedule. Both the EPMA and its Regulations can be purchased from the SNP Corporation Ltd. The entire legislation can also be downloaded from the website at  [http://lawnet.com.sg/](http://lawnet.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}
3.  The Certification of Import/Export signed by the Hazardous Substances Licence holder must be under the importer/exporter company's letterhead. The format can be found in Annex F.
4.  If you or your importers/exporters do not have the required Hazardous Substances Licence, please contact CCMD officers at 67319641 or 67319332 for advice.

^Footnote: The ICDV application procedure has been changed from manual submission and collection at Customs office to electronic application via the Networked Trade Platform (NTP) with effect from  20 June  2018.  With the change in procedure, traders enjoy time savings in terms of traveling time for making the trip to Customs office, going to SingPost to make payment for the fee, and waiting at Customs office for their applications to be processed as what happened in the past.  Traders could now enjoy the convenience of submitting the ICDV application electronically from their office or anywhere and receiving the approval electronically from Customs via the NTP. As such, the service standard has been revised to adapt to the new electronic application procedure.

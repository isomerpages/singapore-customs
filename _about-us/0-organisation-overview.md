# Organisation Overview
Singapore Customs – a department under the Ministry of Finance – is the lead agency for trade facilitation and revenue enforcement.

Reconstituted on 1 April 2003 to bring together revenue collection and enforcement, trade documentation, trade facilitation and security functions under one agency, Singapore Customs upholds customs and trade laws to build trust in Singapore’s external trading system, facilitate trade, and protect revenue.

We facilitate Singapore’s external trade, through collaboration with government agencies and businesses, robust regulations and effective enforcement.

We play a proactive role in balancing the intricate requirements of trade facilitation, security, and regulatory compliance to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global trade hub trusted by foreign trading partners and businesses operating in Singapore.

# Importing by Postal or Courier Service

Goods (e.g. new or used articles, online purchases, gifts) imported by post or courier services are subject to payment of [Goods and Services Tax (GST)](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst)  and/or  [duty](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods).

GST relief is granted on goods imported by post or air, excluding intoxicating liquors and tobacco, with a total  [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports) not exceeding S$400. Please note that GST relief is not granted for goods imported by other transport modes, e.g. sea freight and land, unless specified. Please see [Quick Guide for Importers / How to Import Your Goods?](/businesses/importing-goods/overview) for more information.

## Things to Note for International Parcels Delivered by Post or Courier Service

**Determining the total CIF value**

To determine the total CIF value, all **goods consigned to the same importer and arriving in Singapore on the same flight** are treated as a whole, even if the goods are covered by **different freight documents**. The importer is the party indicated as the consignee in the freight documents such as the House Airway Bill (HAWB) or consignment note. In cases where end buyers are named as the consignees in different consignment notes and the courier service company or freight forwarder is named as the consignee in the HAWB, each of the end buyers may be considered as an importer.

Where the insurance and freight charges are excluded from the value of the goods, importers may use the  [flat rates for freight and insurance](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/flat-rates-for-freight-and-insurance)  provided by Singapore Customs to compute the customs value of the goods and determine the GST and/or duty payable. For goods imported by **post**, if the insurance and freight charges are excluded from the value of the goods, the postage charge paid shall be taken as the insurance and freight charges to be included in the CIF value of the goods and determination of the GST and/or duty payable.

**Check for Controlled Goods**

Please also check if your goods are  [controlled goods](/businesses/importing-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-import)  or goods subject to restrictions by Competent Authorities (CAs) in Singapore, and obtain the relevant Import permits and authorisation from the relevant CAs if necessary.

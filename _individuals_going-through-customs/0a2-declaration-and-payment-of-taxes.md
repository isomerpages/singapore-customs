# Declaration and Payment of Taxes

## What to declare?

Under Singapore’s laws, arriving travellers are required to declare and pay the duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) to bring in dutiable and taxable goods exceeding their  [duty-free concession and GST relief](/individuals/going-through-customs/arrivals/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief). This is applicable whether the goods were purchased overseas or in Singapore.

***

## Dutiable Goods and GST Taxable Goods
There are four categories of dutiable goods in Singapore:

-   **Intoxicating liquors**, including spirits, wine, beer, ale, stout and porter
    -   Beverages and liquors consumed for health reasons and used for cooking are dutiable if the alcoholic strength by volume exceeds 0.5% (eg shandy, bottled alcoholic cocktail drinks, D.O.M., Yomeishu, samsoo and rice wine)
-   **Tobacco products**, including cigarettes and cigars
    -   With effect from 1 July 2020, all cigarettes and other tobacco products imported into, sold, offered for sale or distributed in Singapore must comply with the new Standardised Packaging (SP) requirements. For further information, you may refer to Health Sciences Authority (HSA)’s [website](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/tobacco-regulation/overview) or contact Ministry of Health (MOH) through email at [moh_info@moh.gov.sg](maito:moh_info@moh.gov.sg). 
    -   Importation of cigarettes and / or tobacco products that do not comply with the SP requirements is not allowed, and these cigarettes and / or tobacco products will be disposed of at the checkpoints. 
    -   Travellers have to ensure that their cigarettes and / or tobacco products comply with the SP requirements before making a declaration and payment via the Customs@SG mobile app or web portal. Do note that no refund will be given for duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) already prepaid via the [Customs@SG web application](/eservices/customs-sg-web-application/) for cigarettes and / or tobacco products that do not comply with the SP requirements.
-   **Motor vehicles**, including motorised bicycles
-   **Motor fuel**, including motor spirits, diesel products and compressed natural gas (CNG)

All goods imported into Singapore are subject to GST.

Payment of Duties and GST can be made via the following payment modes:

-   All major credit cards (MasterCard, Visa and American Express), mobile wallets, NETS and Cashcard at the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office
-   Visa or Master credit cards on the  [Customs@SG Web Application](/eservices/customs-sg-web-application/)

## How to declare?

Major traveller entry checkpoints in Singapore operate the Red and Green Channels system. The Red and Green Channel signs are above the examination counters in the arrival hall after immigration clearance. At certain checkpoints, forward security checks are conducted  __before immigration clearance__ . If you are carrying any dutiable, taxable, controlled or prohibited goods, please declare them to the checking officer at the Red Channel or at the Customs Examination Area before immigration clearance.

If in doubt, always ask the checking officers at the Red Channel/Customs Examination Area or approach the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office.

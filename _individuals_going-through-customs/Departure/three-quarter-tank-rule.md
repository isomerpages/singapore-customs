# Three-Quarter Tank Rule

Under the Customs Act, Singapore-registered vehicles are required to have a minimum amount of motor fuel (at least three-quarters of the tank) when leaving Singapore via the land checkpoints. This is commonly referred to as the “three-quarter tank rule”.

The three-quarter tank rule is currently applied to vehicles running on petrol and/or compressed natural gas (CNG). For hybrid vehicles running on petrol and CNG, drivers should ensure that both the petrol and CNG fuel tanks are at least three-quarter full.

With effect from 1 April 2019, the three-quarter tank rule will be expanded to cover Singapore-registered diesel-powered vehicles. This is in line with the introduction of a usage-based diesel duty announced in Budget 2017 to reduce diesel consumption and resultant air pollution.

Drivers who do not meet the rule may be issued with a composition sum of up to $500, or be prosecuted in court. Drivers may also be required to perform a U-turn at the land checkpoints if they are caught committing the offence.

If the vehicle’s fuel gauge is tampered, the driver may be charged in court for illegal alteration of the fuel measuring equipment. More information on customs offences is available [here](/individuals/going-through-customs/offences).

To avoid any inconvenience to your overseas trip, Singapore Customs would like to remind drivers to ensure that their fuel tank is at least three-quarters full when exiting the land checkpoints.

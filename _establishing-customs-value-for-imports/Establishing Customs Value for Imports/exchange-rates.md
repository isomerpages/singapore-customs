# Exchange Rates

If any component of the customs value is settled in a foreign currency, that value should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency in Singapore, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.

An example is shown below:

-Question

Company A sold 100 boxes of batteries to Company B at Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) US$10,000 but states that payment should be     settled in Singapore Dollars at S$13,700. Which of the 2 currencies should be used to determine the customs value?

-Answer

Since Company B paid for the batteries in Singapore Dollars, the amount of S$13,700 should be used to determine the customs value.

However, if Company B is to pay US$10,000 to Company A, then the exchange rate should be used to convert US$10,000 to Singapore         Dollars to determine the customs value.

## Weekly Average Exchange Rates

To provide facilitation, you may use the weekly average exchange rates, published by the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/Statistics/msb/ExchangeRates.aspx){:target="_blank"} in the preceding week, when making declarations to Customs for the current week.

E.g. Exchange rates for the period 4 May â€“ 10 May 2020 are based on the weekly average exchange rates for Period ending 30 Apr 2020 from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Please refer to the guide [here](/documents/businesses/Retrieving_Weekly_Rates_from_MAS.pdf){:target="_blank"} on retrieving the weekly average exchange rates.

## Foreign currencies not listed in Exchange Rates

If any component of the customs value is settled in a foreign currency not listed on Monetary Authority of Singapore's website, that value in foreign currency should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency from reputable sources such as banks in Singapore, local circulated newspapers, reputable news agencies or online resources, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.

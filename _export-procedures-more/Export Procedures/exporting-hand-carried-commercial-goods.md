# Exporting Hand-Carried Commercial goods

## Exporting under Hand-Carried Export Scheme (HCES)

For departure via Changi International Airport, traders must present the goods with the relevant Customs Export permit, supporting invoice and boarding pass/confirmed air-ticket to Singapore Customs officers for inspection.

Please refer to IRASâ€™ website for more details on [HCES](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/GST/Hand-Carried-Exports-Scheme--HCES-/){:target="_blank"}.

For departure via other checkpoints, please note that HCES is not applicable.

## Exporting Trade Samples via Hand-Carry

Please refer to [Exporting Trade Samples](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/exporting-trade-samples) for the permit requirements.

## Exporting Temporary Imported Goods via Hand-Carry

For the export of temporary imported goods (i.e. for unsold exhibition goods) via hand-carry, a Customs export permit is required to export the remaining goods at the end of the exhibition.

The exhibitor or the local Declaring Agent must produce the export permit together with the goods for Customs verification and endorsement at the exit point.

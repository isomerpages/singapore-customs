# How to Renew /Extend/Discharge Security?

## Renewal of Security

If you have lodged a security with Singapore Customs expiring in the month of December, Singapore Customs will inform you of the recommended security amount to lodge for the following year in November of the current year.

The recommended security amount is computed based on your entityâ€™s past transaction and its [TradeFIRST (TF) band](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first), [Declaring Agent (DA) band](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/apply-update-renew-terminate-declaring-agent-account-and-declarant/declaring-agent-account) and your compliance records with Singapore Customs. Entities that have been accorded a better TF band or DA band, or have maintained exemplary compliance records can expect lower or waiver of security requirements for most types of transactions.  
  
If your security does not expire in the month of December, you will be notified on the expiry of your security two months before the expiry date.

## Extension of Security

You may extend the expiry date of your existing security using the [Security Extension Form](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links). Please note that the processing by your bank, finance company or insurance company may **take up to three to four weeks**.  You are encouraged to submit your security extension to Customs at least two weeks before the expiry of your existing security to allow sufficient time for processing and amendments in case of discrepancies.


## Discharge of Security

You may email your request for an early discharge of your security to [Customs_Documentation@customs.gov.sg](mailto:Customs_Documentation@customs.gov.sg). We will discharge the original security once we have confirmed that you do not have any outstanding matters with us.

# What is it?

TradeFIRST stands for Trade Facilitation & Integrated Risk-based System. It is an integrated assessment framework that provides a holistic assessment of a company and determines the level of facilitation accorded.

The assessment is free and it is mandatory for all companies who wish to apply for a Singapore Customs scheme or licence.

## Benefits of TradeFIRST

**Greater Facilitation**

We adopt a risk management approach to classify the level of facilitation into 5 bands - Basic, Standard, Intermediate, Enhanced and Premium.

![tradefirst1 - Copy](/images/tradefirst1%20-%20Copy.jpg)

**The higher your TradeFIRST band, the greater the facilitation accorded to you.**

For example,  a company that obtains a Premium band can enjoy the facilitation and schemes accorded to the Premium band and the ones below it (in this case, Basic to Premium).

This list shows the various Customs facilitation and schemes under each TradeFIRST band.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

This section guides companies who wish to perform a TradeFIRST self-assessment under specific business operations mentioned below.

**Companies with Multiple Sites and/or Multiple Schemes**

There will only be one assessment for the company regardless of the number of schemes it applies for. Therefore, the self-assessment checklist should be filled in relation to all of the company’s operating sites.

All of its operating sites must be declared in the checklist:

-   Indicate “Yes” if the company meets the criteria for all sites.
-   Indicate “No” if none or only some of the sites meet the criteria. Indicate the name of the site(s) which meet the criteria in the “Comments” column.
-   Indicate “N.A.” when the criterion is not applicable.


**Outsourced Functions**

The company should not indicate “N.A.” on outsourced functions, for example using third party logistics providers. It should indicate if its business partners’ procedures meet the criteria based on its service level agreements and contractual obligations.


**Company is a Tenant**

The company should abide by these  [guidelines](/files/businesses/selfassessmtguidelines.doc)  if it is a tenant.


**Companies with Global or Regional Offices**

TradeFIRST assessment us only applicable to the company's procedures conducted on its operating sites in Singapore. For example, comments on pre-employment verification criteria must pertain to Singapore's procedures and not the company's regional or global practices.

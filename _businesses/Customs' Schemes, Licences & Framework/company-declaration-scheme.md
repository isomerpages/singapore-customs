## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1) My company plans to move out of ALPS permanently. Can we apply for the Company Declaration Scheme to move our goods that are GST-paid / accounted for out of ALPS without having to pay GST a second time?**

No, you should not apply for the Company Declaration Scheme for the purpose of relocating out of ALPS. This is because the scheme is meant for export-oriented companies in ALPS to re-import goods that are GST-paid / accounted for into customs territory for valid business reasons.

**2) How do I check if the goods are controlled or dutiable?**

For dutiable goods, please refer to the  [List of Dutiable Goods](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods).

For controlled items, you may check using this  [search engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do). If a product is controlled, the "Import", "Export" and "Transhipment" columns of the search results will indicate the Competent Authorities controlling the product.

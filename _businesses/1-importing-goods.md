Goods granted GST import relief include new articles, souvenirs, gifts and food preparations intended for the travellerâ€™s personal use or consumption. The GST import relief does not apply to intoxicating liquor and tobacco, as well as goods imported for commercial purposes. Holders of a work permit, employment pass, student pass, dependent pass or long-term pass issued by the Singapore Government, and crew members are not entitled to GST import relief.

Travellers are required to pay GST on the value of the goods that exceeds the amount of GST import relief granted to them.

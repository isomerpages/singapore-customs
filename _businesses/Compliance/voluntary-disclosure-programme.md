# Voluntary Disclosure Programme

Under the Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP), individuals and companies are encouraged to voluntarily disclose their declaration errors and omissions.

Disclosure applies to all types of offences under laws and regulations administered and enforced by Singapore Customs.

## Am I Eligible to Make a Disclosure?

You are eligible for this programme if your disclosure is:

-   Complete, with all relevant information submitted and,
-   Made before notification or commencement of audit checks and investigations

There is no fixed time period for making a voluntary disclosure.

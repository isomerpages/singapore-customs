# Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme

## What is it?

The Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme (ZGS) allows approved companies to store  **imported non-dutiable**  goods for an indefinite period of time in a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs, with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) suspended. This designated area is termed as licensed premises.

GST is payable when these goods are removed from the zero-GST warehouse for local use or consumption. GST is not payable when these goods are removed for export, or when supply or sale of these goods takes place while they are in the warehouse.

You may refer to an  [overview of the procedures](/documents/businesses/overview2.doc)  for storing non-dutiable imports in zero-GST warehouses.

## Types of Licences under ZGS

There are 3 licence types to cater to the different needs of companies:

-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type I
-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type II
-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type III

The level of facilitation accorded, as well as the criteria on the company’s record-keeping and internal controls standard, increase from Type I to Type III.

Type I and II licensees need to qualify for the “Standard” and “Intermediate” bands under the  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) framework respectively, while Type III licensees need to qualify for the “Enhanced” or the “Premium” bands.

A summary of the benefits for the 3 zero-GST warehouse licence types can be found in the  [Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme Handbook](/documents/businesses/SEB/Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme Handbook (Jul 2021).pdf)  (Chapter 2.10).

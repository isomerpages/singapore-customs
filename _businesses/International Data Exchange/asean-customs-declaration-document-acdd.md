## Electronic exchange of the ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) under the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is a regional initiative that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS. <br> 

The ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) is an electronic document to facilitate the exchange of export declaration information between exchange-ready AMS. It contains a specific set of TradeNet export permit data, which will be sent to the Customs authority in the importing exchange-ready AMS for the purpose of supplementing risk management by the Customs authority in the importing country. The expected benefits for participating traders include potential reduction in Customs clearance time for consignments which are supported by the ACDD and imported into exchange-ready AMS. <br>

The ACDD is optional and open to all traders who export goods to an exchange-ready AMS. The exchange-ready AMS are: <br>
  a)  Cambodia<br>
  b)  Malaysia<br>
  c)  Myanmar<br>
  d)  Thailand<br>

More AMS will commence live operation when they are ready to do so.<br>

The specific TradeNet export permit data that would be sent as an ACDD to an importing exchange-ready AMS are:<br>

  a)  Exporter UEN<br>
  b)  Exporter Company Name<br>
  c)  Consignee Company Name<br>
  d)  Consignee Company Address<br>
  e)  Declaring Agent UEN<br>
  f)  Declaring Agent Company Name<br>
  g)  Departure Date<br>
  h)  Item HS Code<br>
  i)  Item HS Quantity<br>
  j)  Item HS Quantity UOM<br>
  k)  Item Country of Origin of Goods<br>
  l)  Outward Transport Mode<br>
  m)  Port of Discharge<br>
  n)  Serial Number of Item; and<br>
  o)  TradeNet Permit Number.<br>

## Participation in the Electronic Exchange of ACDD

**Step 1: Participation in the Electronic Exchange of ACDD and Authorisation of Singapore Customs to Transmit ACDD**<br><br>
Traders exporting goods from Singapore who wish to participate in the exchange of ACDD should submit a duly completed ACDD participation form to Singapore Customs. The form: <br>
  a)  indicates the traders’ participation in the exchange of ACDD; <br>
  b)  provides consent to Singapore Customs to send the ACDD to the importing exchange-ready AMS; and <br>
  c)  informs Singapore Customs of their Declaring Agent(s) who are authorised to provide such consent on the traders’ behalf in TradeNet export permit applications.<br>


The ACDD participation form can be accessed from the [ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) section on the Customs Forms and Service Links page](https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links). Singapore Customs will contact you within 7 working days upon receipt of the completed form on the outcome of the application.<br>

Traders who wish to<br> 
  a)  withdraw from participation in the electronic exchange of ACDD and withdraw consent for the transmission of ACDD-required information to the AMS Customs Authority; <br>
  b)  inform Singapore Customs of revocation of authority of any DA(s); or <br>
  c)  inform Singapore Customs of additional DA(s) after submission of this form, <br>
please send an email to Customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg.<br>



**Step 2: TradeNet Declaration Procedures**<br><br> 
There will be no change to the TradeNet permit application procedures. To authorise Singapore Customs to send the ACDD to an importing exchange-ready AMS (specified in the “country of final destination” field in the export permit), the Declaring Agent has to:<br>

  a)  Select “International Data Exchange” under the “Customs Procedure Code (CPC)” field; and<br>
  b)  Key in “ACDD” at the “Procedure Code 1 (PC1)” field.

Please note that amendments to and/or cancellation of TradeNet permit applications will not be sent to the Customs authority of the importing exchange-ready AMS, as these functionalities are currently not available for ACDD. Should there be any changes to the export information in the permit application after the ACDD information has been sent to the importing exchange-ready AMS, the onus is on your company to update the importing exchange-ready AMS of the changes.

"International Data Exchange” under the “CPC” field is available for the following message and declaration types as shown below:

| Message Type | Declaration Type Reference |
|--|--|
| OUT | APS (Approved Premises / Schemes)|
|  | DRT (Direct) |
|  | TCS (Temporary Consignments previously imported with/without sales) |
|  | TCR (Temporary Consignments previously imported for repair) |
|  | TCE (Temporary Consignments previously imported for exhibition) |
|  | TCO (Temporary Consignments previously imported for other purposes) |
|  | TCI (Temporary Consignments for export / re-import of local goods) |
| INP (In-Non Payment)| REX (Re-Export) |

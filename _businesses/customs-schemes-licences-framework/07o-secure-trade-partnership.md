# Secure Trade Partnership (STP) & STP-Plus

## What are these?

### Secure Trade Partnership (STP)

The STP is a voluntary certification programme consistent with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards to secure and facilitate global trade.

The programme encourages companies to adopt robust security measures using a risk-based approach in their trading operations to improve global supply chain security. By participating in the programme, a company demonstrates commitment and willingness in keeping the supply chain secure.

This programme is open to all supply chain stakeholders, including importers, exporters, manufacturers, freight forwarders, warehouse operators, transporters and terminal operators. It allows flexibility and customisation of security measures based on the company’s business model and its role in the supply chain.

### STP-Plus

A company with higher security measures in place will be eligible for STP-Plus. It will also receive additional facilitation through the Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with our partners.

An MRA is a formal document signed between 2 customs administrations where both national supply chain security programmes are recognised and accepted between the signing parties. An MRA with a partner means our security requirements and validation process of STP is consistent with the partner’s programme. Hence, the certified status of a STP-Plus company will also be recognised by the MRA partner.

## Benefits

Companies with robust security measures will benefit from increased visibility of goods in the supply chain, reduction in pilferages and greater efficiency in their supply chain management.

In addition, STP-Plus certified companies will enjoy these benefits:

-   Cargo is less likely to be inspected locally
-   Recognised as a lower risk company
-   Reduced inspection or expedited clearance if its certified status is also recognised by other partners through a mutual recognition arrangement
-   A dedicated account manager assigned as a single contact point to Singapore Customs
-   Recognised as a known consignor under the Regulated Air Cargo Agent Regime

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1)** **What are the requirements to obtain STP or STP-Plus certification?**

To attain the STP certification, a company has to meet most of the requirements in the STP guidelines and criteria, and achieve at least an “Intermediate” band under the TradeFIRST assessment.

For the STP-Plus certification, a company must meet all the stipulated requirements in the STP guidelines and criteria, and achieve the “Premium” band under the TradeFIRST assessment. The STP-Plus certification will last for 3 years.

**2)** **Can my company submit one STP application to obtain certifications for two different entities? For example, entities with two different Unique Entity Numbers (UENs) although both entities are under the same company group?**

No. These entities are considered different legal entities and therefore require separate applications.

**3)** **Will my company be certified as STP or STP-Plus automatically if we are already certified with other supply chain security standards (for example, Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA), ISO 28 000)?**

No. The scope and objective of other supply chain standards are different from STP, and hence cannot be a direct substitution. For example, apart from robust security measures, a company must also have good compliance records with Singapore Customs and other relevant government authorities to be certified under the STP programme.

# Kimberley Process Certification Scheme

## What is it?

The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is an international scheme to stop the trade of ”conflict diamonds” and to ensure that diamond purchases do not finance violence by rebel movements and their allies seeking to undermine legitimate governments. Singapore has been a Kimberley Process (KP)  [participant](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/customs-schemes-licences-framework/cir072004.pdf?la=en&hash=16FD7D5ABB336C039C3617F25BDEA97AD8622123)  since 2004.

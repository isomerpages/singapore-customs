# Apex Licence

## What is it?

The Apex Licence is a premium licence designed for existing Singapore Customs licensees holding multiple licences to support their diverse warehouse operations.

It allows approved companies to hold a single licence and pay a single licence fee. For example, an Apex Licence will cover both the storage of non-dutiable goods under the  [Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/zero-gst-warehouse-scheme) and dutiable goods under the  [Licensed Warehouse Scheme](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/licensed-warehouse-scheme).

Companies holding an Apex Licence will enjoy savings in licence fees, simplified documentation requirements as well as greater flexibility in their business operations.

## How to Qualify?

To qualify for the Apex Licence, the company must:

-   Hold more than one existing licence with Singapore Customs
-   Have good compliance records with Singapore Customs
-   Operate a robust computerised inventory system which is able to track and account for the inventory status and movement of all goods across multiple locations
-   Undergo  [TradeFIRST assessment](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/tradefirst) and attain the Premium band

## Licence Fee

The Apex Licence fee is pegged to the highest licence fee of any individual licence the company holds with Singapore Customs.

For example, if a company is paying $4,000 for the Licensed Warehouse licence and $2,500 for the Zero-GST Warehouse licence, the fee for the Apex Licence would be $4,000.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1.** **Where can I find the Harmonised System (HS) codes and duty rates of dutiable goods?**

Find out more about  [Duty Rates of Dutiable Goods](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods) and access the  [Harmonised System (HS) Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do).

**2.** **How do I compute the excise duty payable on locally manufactured liquors?**

**Formula**

*Total excise duty = Total quantity in litres x Excise duty per litre of alcohol x % of alcoholic strength*

For example, the total excise duty payable on 1,000 litres of locally manufactured stout with 5% alcoholic strength will be:  
1,000 litres x $60 x 0.05 = $3,000.

**3.** **Do I need to seek prior approval from Singapore Customs to import apparatus or power-operated machinery for the manufacture of dutiable goods?**

Yes, prior approval from Singapore Customs is required before these goods are imported.

**4.** **Is the licence subject to renewal?**

-   Payment of the annual licence fee
-   Lodgement of the Banker’s Guarantee or Insurance Bond, if applicable
-   Compliance records with Singapore Customs
-   Outcome of the  [TradeFIRST](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/tradefirst) assessment

**5.** **Is the licence transferable?**

The licence is strictly non-transferable. There should be no sub-letting of the excise factory. The manufacturer is responsible for the movement of all goods in and out of the excise factory.

# Licensed Warehouse Scheme

## What is it?

The Licensed Warehouse (LW) Scheme allows approved companies to store imported dutiable goods, namely liquor, tobacco, motor vehicles,  [petroleum and biodiesel blends](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/petroleum-licences), for an indefinite period of time in a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs, with the duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) suspended. This designated area is termed as licensed premises.

Duty and GST will be payable when these goods are removed from the licensed warehouse for local use or consumption. Duty and GST are not payable when these goods are removed for export, or when supply or sale of these goods takes place while they are in the warehouse.

You may refer to an  [overview of the procedures](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/customs-schemes-licences-framework/overview1.doc?la=en&hash=790A90DAE8C3F8E538FFB8C41ECEDDDDA87CF88C)  for storing dutiable imports in licensed warehouses.

## Types of Licences under the LW Scheme

There are 3 licence types to cater to the different needs of companies:

-   Licensed Warehouse Type I
-   Licensed Warehouse Type II
-   Licensed Warehouse Type III

The level of facilitation accorded, as well as the criteria on the company’s record-keeping and internal controls standard, increase from Type I to Type III.

Type I and II licensees need to qualify for the “Standard” and “Intermediate” bands under the  [TradeFIRST](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/tradefirst) framework respectively, while Type III licensees need to qualify for the “Enhanced” or the “Premium” bands.

A summary of the benefits for the 3 LW licence types can be found in the  [Licensed Warehouse Scheme Handbook](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/customs-schemes-licences-framework/lwhandbook_may2017version.pdf?la=en&hash=FF4D53963CE9B5460ADFCDD9B6FA316250A385AC)  (Chapter 2.8).

## Licence Fee

An annual licence fee is payable upon issuance of the licence. It is based on the projected potential duty*  or the average past monthly duty**  of the dutiable goods stored in the licensed premises:

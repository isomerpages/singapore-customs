# Introduction
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is an international treaty which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons and stipulates their timely destruction. It entered into force in 1997.

The  [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://www.opcw.org/){:target="_blank"} (OPCW) is the implementing body for the CWC. Its activities include monitoring the implementation status of  [Member States](https://www.opcw.org/about-us/member-states){:target="_blank"}, conducting on-site verification measures and providing a forum for consultation and co-operation amongst Member States.

Singapore ratified the CWC in May 1997 and Singapore Customs is the designated National Authority (NA) for the CWC (NA(CWC)).

The NA(CWC) is the national focal point and liaison with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (the implementing body of the CWC), and other Member States of the Convention. The NA(CWC) administers the  [Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act and its subsidiary legislations](/businesses/compliance/overview)  to fulfil Singaporeâ€™s obligations under the Convention.

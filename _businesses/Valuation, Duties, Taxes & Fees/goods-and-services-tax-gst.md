# Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied on all goods imported into Singapore. It is calculated based on:

-   Customs value of the goods, plus all duties, or
-   Value of the last selling price plus all duties, if there has been more than one sale (when the last buyer is the party declaring the payment permit)

The current GST rate is 7%.

Examples on the calculation of GST:

## 1.  Non-Dutiable Goods
   
GST payable = *7% x Customs value or Last Selling Price (LSP)*

Company A bought 100 boxes of vitamins at S$900 on  [Free on Board (FOB) incoterms](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/flat-rates-for-freight-and-insurance). The overseas freight, handling and insurance charges to ship the vitamins to Singapore cost S$100. Company A sold the vitamins to Company B before the vitamins reached Singapore for S$1,500. What is the GST payable by Company B?

GST payable by Company B = 7% x S$1,500=S$105

## 2.  Dutiable Goods
    
GST payable = *7% x (Customs value or Last Selling Price (LSP) + duties payable)*

Company A imported a motor car that was bought at S$100,000 on  [Free on Board (FOB) incoterms](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/flat-rates-for-freight-and-insurance). The overseas freight, handling and insurance charges to ship the car to Singapore cost S$1,000. Assuming  [the excise duty](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods)  for motor cars is 20% of the customs value:

Customs value of car = S$101,000

Duties payable = S$101,000 x 20%=S$20,200

Thus, GST payable = 7% x (S$101,000 + 20,200)=S$8,484

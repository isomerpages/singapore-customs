# Controlled & Prohibited Goods for Export

Controlled goods require proper authorisation (advance notification, licence or certificate approval) from  **Competent Authorities (CA)** before they may be exported from Singapore. You are advised to check if your goods are controlled using the description of the product, Harmonized System (HS) code or CA product code [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="_blank"}. If the item is subject to control you may check directly with the respective [CAs](/documents/businesses/PSB/TN Team/annex-e-ca-helpdesk-list.pdf){:target="_blank"} on their requirements.

## How to apply for back-to-back preferential Certificate of Origin with Singapore Customs?

The back-to-back preferential CO is issued by Singapore Customs for the re-export of goods based on the preferential CO issued by the first exporting party. The goods must be imported into Singapore and meet the conditions for it to be issued.

In general, the re-export may be eligible for a back-to-back preferential CO issued under a specific Free Trade Agreement (FTA), under the following conditions:

-   The FTA Contains a back-to-back preferential CO provision;
    
-   The first exporting country, Singapore, and the final importing country are Parties to the same FTA;
    
-   The goods are imported into Singapore from the first exporting country and re-exported from Singapore to the final importing country;
    
-   The import of the goods into Singapore is covered by a preferential CO issued by the issuing authority in the first exporting country;
    
-   The goods do not undergo any further processing in Singapore; and
    
-   The goods fulfill the relevant requirements in the [Operational Certification Procedures](/documents/businesses/Back-to-back-pco-legal-text-reference-Aug-2019.pdf) of the FTA.

Please refer to the legal text of the respective [Free Trade Agreements](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/overview){:target="_blank"} for the eligibility requirements for back-to-back preferential CO application.

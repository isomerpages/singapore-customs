## Electronic Exchange of Form D via the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is an environment that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS.

You may apply for e-Form under ATIGA if you are exporting to:

-   Brunei Darussalam
-   Cambodia;
-   Indonesia;    
-   Lao PDR;    
-   Malaysia;    
-   Myanmar;    
-   Thailand; and    
-   Vietnam.
    
Under the live operation of the ASW, a Form D under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) electronically transmitted (e-ATIGA Form D) from Singapore to any of the above-mentioned AMS for an import will also enjoy preferential tariff treatment. No other Certificates of Origin can currently be transmitted via the ASW.

To transmit an e-ATIGA Form D, the exporter must first be registered with Singapore Customs to access to TradeNet. There is no change to the Form D application procedures in TradeNet. However, the applicant must access the approved Form D in the TradeNet Backend thereafter to authorise and trigger the transmission of the e-ATIGA Form D to the importing country via the ASW.

To register, please fill in the application form to register for the ASW [here](https://form.gov.sg/5d1330b145677e0011c1c97a).

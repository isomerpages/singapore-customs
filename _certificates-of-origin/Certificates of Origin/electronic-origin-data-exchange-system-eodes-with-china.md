# Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) with China

The transmission of the electronic Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) / electronic Certificate of Non-Manipulation (CNM) to China was established on 1 November 2019 and with effect from 1 May 2020, China has implemented full electronic transmission of PCO eliminating the need for hardcopy Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) to be despatched overseas. To benefit from the seamless clearance of the goods that exporters and their appointed declaring agents/freight forwarders will enjoy, it would be best to leverage on the International Connectivity PCO (IC PCO) service on Networked Trade Platform (NTP). 

Apart from exporters,importers who wish to claim preferential treatment for import of goods from China to Singapore or to apply for a back-to-back PCO would be able to retrieve the electronic PCO issued by China via the ICPCO service. 

For more information on how you could sign up for the IC PCO service, please refer to [Notice 18/2019](/news-and-media/notices/2019-10-15-N.pdf) under News and Media > Notices. Additonally, you may wish to download the [handbook](/documents/businesses/Transmission and Receipt of Electronic Preferential Certificate of Origin via Networked Trade Platform (Mar 2021).pdf) to understand more on the procedures to follow when trasmitting the PCO electronically to China.

# ASEAN-Wide Self-Certification (AWSC) scheme

ASEAN signed the First Protocol to amend the ASEAN Trade In Goods Agreement (ATIGA) so as to implement the ASEAN-Wide Self-Certification (AWSC) scheme which will be implemented on 20 September 2020.  Companies in Singapore will be able to participate in this scheme and benefit from the preferential tariff given under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) upon being approved as Certified Exporter (CE).
 
AWSC is a unified Self-Certification scheme under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA). It is a trade facilitation initiative that allows CEs in all ASEAN Member States to self-declare the origin for their exports under ATIGA instead of applying for a Certificate of Origin (FORM D) with the Certificate Issuing Authority in their respective State. Self-Certification enables a CE to make an Origin Declaration on certain commercial documents such as the invoice, bill of lading, delivery order or packing list.

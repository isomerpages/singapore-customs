# Temporary Export Duration and Extension

For goods temporarily exported as trade samples or for repair purposes, these goods have to be re-imported into Singapore within 3 months from the date of export.

If you require an extension beyond 3 months for such goods, please email us at [customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg) with the relevant explanations and supporting documents for our assessment.

For all other goods and purposes, there is no limit to the duration you may export the goods. However, you may be required to provide the following documentary proof that the goods were GST-paid and previously temporarily exported from Singapore under a [Customs Out (Temporary Consignment) permit](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/types-of-export-permits):

-   Temporary export permit
-   Bill of Lading or Airway Bill
-   Commercial invoice
-   Packing list
-   Any other documents as specified by Customs

Traders should follow these procedures to apply for permits for temporary imports for all approved purposes (excluding scientific/technical goods for experimentation/demonstration):

1.  Seek approval from the relevant Competent Authority (CA) if you are  [importing controlled goods](/businesses/importing-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-import).
2. Obtain the [Customs In-Non Payment (Temporary Consignment) permit](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) via TradeNet.
3.  Submit the following documents together with your submission of the TradeNet declaration:
    
    -   Cover letter stating:
        
       -   Purpose for temporary import
       -   Duration of import
       -   Venue where the goods will be used
    -   CA approval letter (where applicable)
    -   Commercial invoice
    -   Packing list
    -   Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
    -   Any other documents as specified by Singapore Customs
    
4.  Produce the permit and supporting documents for endorsement by checkpoint officers during import cargo clearance.
5.  For re-exportation of goods imported under TIS, apply for a corresponding Customs Out (Temporary Consignment) permit via TradeNet before the actual export. The previous In-Non Payment permit number must be declared in the “Previous Permit No.” field.
6.  Produce the permit and supporting documents for endorsement by checkpoints officers during export cargo clearance.
7.  In addition to the above procedures, please also take note of [additional requirements](/businesses/importing-goods/temporary-import-scheme/additional-requirements-import) for temporary imports.

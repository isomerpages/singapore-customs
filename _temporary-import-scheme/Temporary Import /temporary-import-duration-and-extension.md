# Temporary Import Duration and Extension

Goods may be temporarily imported into Singapore for a maximum of 6 months. If additional time is needed, an extension may be applied through TradeNet. A maximum of 3 months may be applied for each extension. While there is no limit to the number of extension applications, traders may be required to produce additional explanations for such requests.

## How to Apply for Extension

Submit an amendment application for the temporary import permit through TradeNet to amend the temporary import end date with the following documents in your submission of the TradeNet declaration:

1.  Cover letter detailing reason(s) for extension
2.  Commercial invoice
3.  Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
4.  Packing list
5.  Any other documents as specified by Customs

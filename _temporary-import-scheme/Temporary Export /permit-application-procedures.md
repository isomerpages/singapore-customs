![](/images/pap2-export.jpg)

Traders should follow these procedures to apply for permits for temporary exports:

   1.  Seek approval from the Competent Authority (CA) if you are temporarily  [exporting controlled goods](/businesses/exporting-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-export).

   2.  Apply for a [Customs OUT (Temporary Consignment - TCI) permit](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) via TradeNet before the actual export.

   3.  Submit the following documents together with your submission of the Tradenet declaration:
    
        -   Cover letter detailing:
        
            - Purpose of temporary export
            - Duration of temporary export
            
       -   Commercial invoice
       -   Packing list
       -   Any other documents as specified by Singapore Customs
    
   4.  Produce the permit and supporting documents for endorsement by checkpoint officers during export cargo clearance.

   5.  Before the re-importation of the goods, apply for a corresponding [Customs In-Non Payment (TCI) permit](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits)* through TradeNet. The previous [Out (Temporary Consignment) permit](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/types-of-export-permits) number must be declared in the “Previous Permit No.” field. <br> *For motor vehicles that were temporarily exported, a [Customs In-Non Payment (GTR)](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) permit, with place of receipt indicated as “VEHSG”, should be declared instead.
    
   6.  Produce the permit and supporting documents for endorsement by checkpoint officers for clearance during cargo re-import.

   7.  Please also take note of [additional requirements](/businesses/importing-goods/temporary-import-scheme/additional-requirements-export) related to temporary imports.

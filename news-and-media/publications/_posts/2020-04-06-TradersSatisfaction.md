**Pro-Enterprise Ranking (PER) Survey 2017 Results**

The PER Survey aims to measure and improve the effectiveness of current government initiatives to build a pro-enterprise regulatory environment in Singapore. It is commissioned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and involved a total of 28 agencies.

Singapore Customs was ranked fourth out of the 28 government agencies in the 2017 PER Survey. The PER Survey measures five components and the scores for all five components are as follows:

  | Components                      | 2015  | 2016  | 2017\*          |
|---------------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Compliance Costs                | 87\.6 | 88\.7 | 68\.9 \(87\.1\) |
| Review of Rules and Regulations | 89\.9 | 89\.1 | 71\.2 \(90\)    |
| Transparency                    | 87\.9 | 90\.4 | 75\.4 \(94\.3\) |
| Customer's Responsiveness       | 87\.7 | 88\.5 | 74\.5 \(94\.1\) |
| Pro\-enterprise Orientation     | 84\.0 | 84\.6 | 72\.3 \(91\.3\) |

[*Note:* The lower scores were mainly due to a change in computation methodology in 2017 as compared to previous years. Applying the same methodology for past surveys on 2017 would result in the scores as indicated in brackets.]

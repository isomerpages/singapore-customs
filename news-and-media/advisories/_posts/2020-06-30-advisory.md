Singapore Customs has been alerted by a member of the public on a tax notification bearing Singapore Customs’ crest. We wish to clarify that this tax notification or clearance receipt was not issued by Singapore Customs and we do not collect fees for cargo clearance. Singapore Customs also does not issue letters or direct individuals to pay any form of charges to a third party.

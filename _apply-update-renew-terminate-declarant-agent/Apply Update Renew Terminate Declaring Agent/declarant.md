# Declarant

## Application Process

The Key Personnel or Authorised Personnel of a DA can [register an individual as a Declarant](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"} at the point of DA Account application or separately afterwards.

The individual will receive an email requesting him to sign and acknowledge a set of [Terms and Conditions for Declarants](/files/businesses/TCs-Declarant-final.pdf). The individual must ensure that he understands his roles and responsibilities as a Declarant before he signs and acknowledges on the Terms and Conditions for Declarants.

The individual must also enrol for and pass the [Customs Competency Test for Declarants (SC 401)](https://go.gov.sg/sc401){:target="_blank"}. Upon registration and closing of the test session, we will send an invoice to the email address indicated in the application form. Payment must be made through AXS/e-AXS/SIngPost before the due date indicated in the invoice. Upon successful payment, we will send a confirmation of the registration to the same email address indicated in the application form. This is to ensure that Declarants possess adequate knowledge on Customs' documentation and procedures to better advise their clients. There are self-learning avenues on Customs' procedural knowledge available and the individual may visit the  [Customs website](https://www.customs.gov.sg/) and its online resources such as the  [Guide to Customs' Procedures](/businesses/business-resources/elearning), guides to specific schemes etc., or attend courses held at  [Nanyang Polytechnic](https://www.nyp.edu.sg/schools/sbm/lifelong-learning.html?id=other-short-courses){:target="_blank"}  or  [Republic Polytechnic](https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary?searchKeyword=customs){:target="_blank"}.

If a Declarant has changed employment and wish to be registered under another DA, he will not be required to take the competency test again. However, Declarants with poor compliance records with Singapore Customs may be required to re-take and pass the competency test to maintain their Declarant registration status.

### Renewal / Update / Termination Process

For Declarants who are Work Pass holders, the DA's Key Personnel and Declarant will receive email notifications from Singapore Customs to update the new work pass expiry date of the Declarant before the expiry date of the Declarant's Work Pass.

The Key Personnel or Authorised Personnel can log in to  [update](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"}  the Declaring Agent Account (or the Declarant can  [update](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"} his/her Work Pass expiry date) by uploading a copy of the Declarant's new Work Pass and updating the Declarant's new Work Pass expiry date (note: the DA must first renew the Declarant's Work Pass before its expiry with the Ministry of Manpower).

The Key Personnel or Authorised Personnel can log in to update the entity's Declarants' particulars and contact details or terminate Declarants who are no longer applying for permits or who have left the company. Please note that the termination of registered Declarants will result in the termination of their TradeNet IDs.

# Procedures for Courier Parcels

All imported goods, including those delivered by courier service companies are subject to clearance by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the respective Free Trade Zones or Land Checkpoints.

The goods must be covered by relevant import permits and supporting documents such as the commercial invoice, packing list, airway bill and consignment note during clearance at the checkpoint. The clearance procedures and permit requirement for courier parcels would depend on the type of goods and CIF value as shown in the table below:

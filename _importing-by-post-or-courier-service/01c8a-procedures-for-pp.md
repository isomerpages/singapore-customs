-   Where the postal item is intended to be re-exported, the recipient is required to produce to SingPost a TradeNet permit to prove the recipient's intent to re-export or store the goods within the FTZ (pending re-export). Such permits and all other relevant documentation must be kept as supporting documents and produced to Customs upon request.
